Odin Memory Game:

This is part of Odin React curriculum the only difference being typescript used instead of Javascript

1. The game is simple and straightforwd just choose level and play.

2. Your primary aim is to not click same card twice till you can click all cards.

3. There is no localStorage so just refresh if you want to reset Best Score else it'll persist as long as the window is open
